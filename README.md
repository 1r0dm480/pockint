POCKINT (a.k.a. Pocket Intelligence) is being developed be the OSINT Swiss Army Knife for DFIR professionals. Designed to be a lightweight and portable GUI program (to be carried within USBs or investigation VMs), it will provide users with essential OSINT capabilities: an input box will accept typical indicators (URL, IP, MD5) and POCKINT will perform basic OSINT data mining tasks.

POCKINT is scheduled for beta release by the end of May 2019. It will initially be available only for Windows, though versions will also be released for Linux and Mac once a stable v.1 is built.
